Hello, my name is Korneliusz Rabczak.

I have 15 years of technical experience in developing and maintaining highly scalable web applications and enterprise systems. I am a Java and Scala enthusiast, a clean code evangelist, and a software developer for whom continuous learning and self-improvement is a way of life.

I am strongly interested in new technologies and technical leadership, focused on writing quality code using TDD where it fits best. In my daily work, I have a strong preference for teamwork and collaboration over uncoordinated individual efforts, and I enjoy providing technical consultation and advice to fellow team members.

### Current Role
Currently, I am a **Principal Software Architect at SAP** (since January 2024), working on **SAP Signavio Process Governance**.

In this role, I am responsible for:
* **Technical Leadership**: Leading cross-functional development teams and driving the technical strategy and vision for the product, ensuring alignment with the business roadmap.
* **Architecture & Strategy**: Defining architecture characteristics and evolution of the architecture, facilitating workshops to define domains and bounded contexts, and aligning legacy monolith systems with new business purposes.
* **Innovation**: Adopting new technologies and solutions to improve system performance and scalability.
* **Advisory**: Providing technical consultation and advising to leadership and business stakeholders to help make high-level decisions.

Writing this blog is an instrument for documenting my journey and sharing what I learn along the way. You’re welcome to follow along!
