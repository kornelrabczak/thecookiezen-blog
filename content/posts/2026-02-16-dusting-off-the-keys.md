It has been five years. 
---------------------

In tech, five years is a long time. When I last posted, the world looked different, there was no Agentic AI, my daily stack looked different, and most importantly my priorities were in a completely different place.

After a long period of digital silence, I finally spent some time on maintenance of this site. I migrated everything over to Hugo, trading in whatever clunky setup I had before.

But this is not just about a blog migration, it's about what comes next.

Family first
---------------------

The most significant update isn't code related. My wife and I just became parents to a beautiful baby boy. He is 1 week old now. 

I’m excited to get back into the rhythm of writing and building, I’m going into this year knowing that my main priority is being a present parent. Expect my posts to be a mix of technical deep-dives and the occasional "written while the baby is finally napping" reflection.

Getting back to the metal
---------------------

The last three years of my career have been spent in the higher levels of leadership. I love the strategy and the people-building aspect of my role, but I've felt the need to get back into the executional side of things. For 2026, my professional and personal goals are all about engineering:

- Hands-on building: Move closer to the technical implementation again. I want to get back the amazing feeling of building something with my team.
- Open Source: I've been a consumer for too long. This year, I'm aiming to contribute back to the projects that make my professional life easier.
- The AI era: Like everyone else, I've been experimenting with LLMs and local AI models. I have a few "pet projects" in the works that leverage AI for more than just chat, stay tuned for more on those soon.

Having fun
---------------------

If the last five years have taught me anything, it's that life is too short to optimize for things that don't bring you joy. My main goal for 2026 is simple, to have fun. Whether it's building a new project, contributing to already existing ones that I enjoy, or just figuring out how to survive the first few months of parenthood, I want to approach it with curiosity.

It's good to be back.
