Five years have passed
---------------------

In the tech world, that's a long time. When I last posted, the world looked different. There was no Agentic AI, my daily stack was different, and, most importantly, my priorities were completely different.

After a long period of digital silence, I finally spent some time maintaining this site. I migrated everything to Hugo, replacing whatever clunky setup I had before.

However, this is not just about a blog migration; it's about what comes next.

Family first!
---------------------

The most significant update isn’t code-related. My wife and I just became parents to a beautiful baby boy. He is one week old now.

I’m excited to get back into the rhythm of writing and building. I’m going into this year knowing that my main priority is being a present parent. Expect my posts to be a mix of technical deep dives and the occasional reflection written while the baby is finally napping.

Getting back to the metal
---------------------

The last three years of my career have been spent in higher-level leadership roles. I love the strategy and people-building aspects of my role, but I’ve felt the need to return to the execution side of things. For 2026, my professional and personal goals are all about engineering.

- Hands-on building: I want to move closer to technical implementation again. I want to regain the feeling of building things with my team.
- Open Source: I’ve been a consumer for too long. This year, I’m going to contribute to the projects that make my professional life easier.
- The AI era: Like everyone else, I’ve been experimenting with LLMs and local AI models. I have a few “pet projects” in the works that use AI for purposes beyond chat. Stay tuned for more information on those soon!

Having fun
---------------------

The last five years have taught me that life is too short to optimize for things that don't bring you joy. My main goal for 2026 is simple: to have fun. Whether it's building a new project or contributing to existing ones, I'm excited to explore new opportunities.

It feels good to be back.
