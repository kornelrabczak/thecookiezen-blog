Archiledger is a specialized Knowledge Graph and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system designed to give AI assistants persistent memory. Built as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, it enables LLMs to store, connect, and recall information using a structured graph database, effectively solving the context loss problem in stateless conversations. It features  tools for entity and relation management, graph exploration, and vector search, making it a powerful solution for creating personal AI memory banks or analyzing complex codebases.
