LadybugDB Spring is an integration framework that brings Spring Data patterns to LadybugDB. It simplifies graph database interactions for Java developers by providing abstractions, including a NodeRepository for CRUD operations, a LadybugDBTemplate for executing Cypher queries, and built-in connection pooling. With support for annotation-based entity mapping and the Neo4j Cypher DSL, it offers a seamless and type-safe developer experience for building graph-based applications.
