Hello, my name is Korneliusz Rabczak, and I’m a Java developer.

Java passionate, clean code evangelist, big fan of Uncle Bob and his clean code video series. Software developer for whom continuous learning (blogs, participation in conferences, code katas, java user group meetings, reading books) and self improvement is a way of life.

Strongly interested in new technologies, focused on writing good code using TDD.

Writting a blog is my next step in improving myself. I plan to use this blog as an instrument documenting my journey. You’re welcome to follow along, if you’d like. My employment history is on <a href="//pl.linkedin.com/in/kornelrabczak">LinkedIn</a>. If you’d like to say hello, you’re more than welcome to do so at kornel.rabczak[at]thecookiezen.com
